Part A: Work is done in both excel and on a Jupyter Notebook.  Questions 1-5 are fully completed on the Jupyter Notebook using python.  In the Jupyter Notebook the answer/analysis portion for each question is explained under each section of code.  The Excel has questions 1-5 and also has question 6 completed using pivot tables and functions in excel.  There are separate sheets for each question and the answers are in green on each sheet.
Part B: Work is done in a Jupyter Notebook.  The data I chose to test is explained at the top of the Notebook and is followed by the code, charts, and graphs.
