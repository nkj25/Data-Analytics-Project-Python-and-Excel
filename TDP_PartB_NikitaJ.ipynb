    "#### Datasets:\n",
    "    Car_Detail\n",
    "    Median_Household_Incomes\n",
    "#### Hypothesis:\n",
    "    Popularity of vehicle styles is correlated with median household incomes.\n",
    "#### Details:\n",
    "    My reasoning behind choosing this hypothesis is that people who have higher incomes tend to buy more cars.  Cars such as convertibles are not practical for everyday use, especially in changing weather conditions or for families with kids.  Lower income people would most likely steer towards purchasing a practical car style such as a sedan or SUV.  Only data from 2000-2017 was used because certain vehicle styles did not have data for earlier years.  Also, this may reduce the occurrence of possible confounding variables from the 20th to the 21st century.  The vehicle styles chosen were 4 door SUV, convertible, and sedan since these are 3 of the most commonly known car styles and they vary in size and purpose.  The median household incomes per year were used to get an overall mean of the medians for that year based on the states provided.  The mean will give a general overview of the correlation between the two.  To attempt to look at more specific combinations of values, the household incomes from Colorado and New York were also tested to see if there was any variation by state.\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "    Based on data from 2000 to 2017,  the results were only statistically significant when comparing the Mean of Median Incomes vs. 4 door SUV Popularity and Mean of Median Incomes vs. Sedan Popularity.  The Mean of Median Incomes vs. Convertible was not statistically significant.  4 door SUV Popularity is 22.2% correlated to the Mean of Median Incomes, respective to the year.  Sedan Popularity is 56.4% correlated to the Mean of Median Incomes respective, to the year.  Of the three graphs presented below, the lowest variance in the data points occurred when the Mean of Medians was used instead of individual Medians by state.  This could be because it reduces the possibility of bias that is occurring.  However, even for the results that are statistically significant (p>.05), the correlation is positive but it is weak (R<.99) and there is no way to determine if there are confounding variables present.\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
